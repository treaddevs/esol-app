# ESOL Communication App

This project was a partnership between the City of Portland, Maine's Office of Economic Opportunity. Adapted from a [tutorial](https://github.com/codinginflow/nextjs-15-social-media-app) by Coding in Flow, our team developed a central platform for the ESOL Collaborative educators to communicate and share resources.

**IMPORTANT**: After cloning the repo, open the command line inside the project and run `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`.
