# ESOL Communication App

This project was a partnership between the City of Portland, Maine's Office of Economic Opportunity. Adapted from an online [tutorial](https://github.com/codinginflow/nextjs-15-social-media-app) by Coding in Flow, our team developed a central platform for the ESOL Collaborative educators to communicate and share resources.
